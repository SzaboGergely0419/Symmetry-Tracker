# Symmetry Tracker

The aim of this library is to provide a general tracking framework for ML-based time-symmetric tracking.

All codes here were developed by Gergely Szab√≥ during his PhD research at [PPCU](https://itk.ppke.hu/en)

## Main functionalities

All fuctionalities which are intended to be directly used are listed here. The other functions and classes in the library have supportive roles and are only intended to be utilized by the functions listed here.

### Video Transformation
#### TransformVideoFromTIFF
- At: symmetry_tracker/video_transformation.py
- Transforms the input .tiff format video to the appropriate "folder of .png images" format

### Segmentation
#### SingleVideoSegmentation
- At: symmetry_tracker/segmentation/segmentator.py
- Performs segmentation on a single video. The models are only capable of handling the fixed image resolution they were trained on.
#### DisplaySegmentation
- At: symmetry_tracker/segmentation/segmentation_io.py
- Displays segmentation results generated by SingleVideoSegmentation() as images
#### ExportAnnotJSON
- At: symmetry_tracker/segmentation/segmentation_io.py
- Saves segmentation results to JSON, which is later usable for tracking

### Tracking
#### SingleVideoSymmetryTracking
- At: symmetry_tracker/tracking/symmetry_tracker.py
- Performs object tracking using Symmetry Tracking based NN model on a video which was already segmented using both the video and the segmentation outputs
#### SingleVideoKalmanTracking
- At: symmetry_tracker/tracking/kalman_tracker.py
- Performs object tracking using the Kalman Filter on a video which was already segmented using both the video and the segmentation outputs.
This is only a reference estimator, and there are most likely other more convenient Kalman Filter implementations instead of this.
#### SingleVideoSymmetryTracking_L2Distance
- At: symmetry_tracker/tracking/symmetry_tracker_l2dist.py
- Performs object tracking using the Symmetry Tracker in a way that only object centroids are considered for similarity measurement, ignoring morphology
This is only a reference estimator for ablation study, use SingleVideoSymmetryTracking instead for optimal results and performance
#### SingleVideoSymmetryTracking_ShapeDistance
- At: symmetry_tracker/tracking/symmetry_tracker_shapedist.py
- Performs object tracking using the Symmetry Tracker in a way that only object morphology is considered for similarity measurement, ignoring position
This is only a reference estimator for ablation study, use SingleVideoSymmetryTracking instead for optimal results and performance
#### InterpolateMissingObjects
- At: symmetry_tracker/tracking/post_processing.py
- Interpolates the segmentations which should be part of contiuous tracks but were missed. This is not based on heuristics, but the interpolated positions and shapes might not fully match reality. 
Interpolated object instances are displayed with different colors at DisplayTracks() and SaveTracksVideo().
#### DisplayTracks
- At: symmetry_tracker/tracking/tracking_io.py
- Displays the tracking results generated by SingleVideoCellTracking() as images
#### WriteTracks
- At: symmetry_tracker/tracking/tracking_io.py
- Saves tracking results to serial object countour txt format (may loose parts of object instances consisting of multiple contours)
#### ExportTracksJSON
- At: symmetry_tracker/tracking/tracking_io.py
- Saves meaningful tracking results to JSON (data efficient)
#### SaveTracks
- At: symmetry_tracker/tracking/tracking_io.py
- Saves all tracking results to JSON
#### LoadTracks
- At: symmetry_tracker/tracking/tracking_io.py
- Loads all tracking results from JSON
#### SaveTracksVideo
- At: symmetry_tracker/tracking/tracking_io.py
- Saves tracking results as an .mp4 video

### Heuristical post-processing
These functionalities can improve / change tracking results significantly, but are based on additional heuristics and manual setup. 
#### HeuristicalEquivalence
- At: symmetry_tracker/tracking/post_processing.py
- Connects broken up tracks which have a significant metric similarity at the breaking point with a given maximal time difference.
This is a metric similarity between objects on different frames that are not supposed to look the same.
While performing this operation may lead to better results in practice, it is not necessarily sound mathematically and should be used carefully.
#### RemoveShortPaths
- At: symmetry_tracker/tracking/post_processing.py
- Removes the too short paths from a tracking under a given threshold.
